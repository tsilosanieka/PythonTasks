Django Blog Assignment
__________
Model Definition - The `Post` model was defined in `blog/models.py`.

The following is the output from the Django shell, showing that the database queries were successful.

I am filtering for all posts where the `category` is "Tech".

```python
>>> #Filter posts by category
>>> tech_posts = Post.objects.filter(category="Tech")

>>> #Loop through the results and print them
>>> for post in tech_posts:
...     print(post.title, "->", post.content)
```
Output
```
My First Post -> This is task from Python course
My Second Post -> This is about Django models
Another Tech Post -> I am learning Django
```
